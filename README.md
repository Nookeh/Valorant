# Valorant

A sample android app consuming [Valorant API](https://valorant-api.com/) to display valorant agents, it has been built with **Jetpack Compose, Architecture Components** and **MVVM pattern**.

The application architecture is split into 4 principal layers:
- Presentation
- Domain
- Data; and
- Common

For a [small project like this](https://twitter.com/CallebDev/status/1547886517644713984), this is a practical example of screaming architecture üòù.

- For the horizontal infinite auto-scoll, I've used [Accompainist Pager](https://google.github.io/accompanist/pager/)
- I've used [Media Player](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer) for playing agent's voices
- Retrofit for Network calls
- [Landscapist](https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist) for images loading

### In progress üöß.

- [ ] Add retry option to error screens
- [ ] Write tests
